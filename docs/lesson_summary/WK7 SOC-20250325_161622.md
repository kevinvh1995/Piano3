# System on a Chip (SOC) Design and VHDL Implementation
## Understanding Opcodes, Displays, and Structural Design in VHDL

A system on a chip (SOC) is a complete system integrated onto a single chip. A student asks about the project, specifically concerning the "operand result interpreter." They are unsure what is expected of them, possibly due to lack of experience in reading the material. The student understands that the logic and arithmetic unit (ALU) produce an output, and that this output is used by a component to show something on the display. The student is unsure how this output relates to assignment 4, and how opcodes are used with the data. The student understands an input and what the signs should do.

The student's struggle is primarily understanding how to use the opcodes with the data. That is the main point. Input is understood, along with what to do with those inputs, and VHDL is used. But once it is defined, the opcode usage is unclear. This is the main question. The student is using the RISC-V architecture.

Order status is discussed for the PS/2 shield. The student is creating a QR code so students can order what they need. Building the shield yourself will cost 15 euros, but pre-built is 20 euros. The next step is to organize a workshop. BAPO is mentioned, and this will happen outside of all official procedures. To order, payment needs to go to his private bank account. This arrangement is due to HAN university's difficulties in directly supporting these types of student-initiated projects. However, the intention is still to conform with every HAN guideline to ensure a practical, working setup. Asks if that addresses questions.

Default is explained as a reserved word. One student used "default" as a constant in a switch case. This isn't valid in VHDL. The words that are defined for use can't be redefined. LL also isn't allowed. In ALU there are 3 important groups of signals. The first sign on the seven segment display refers to the sign of the numbers, and the remaining segment represent magnitude. This design means plus, minus, zero through F is supported. This design is tied to a choice.

The display of binary numbers can be broken into two parts: the sign and the magnitude. The magnitude refers to the actual value of the number while the sign indicates whether the number is positive or negative. A seven-segment display can show the values 0 through F. So, in a signed display, the magnitude can be displayed on the seven-segment display while the sign ($+$ or $-$) is displayed on a separate display. Depending on how the display is configured, this separate sign display may only show $+$ or $-$, or it may be configured to show 0 or 1 instead. The display settings are important, and the two options are 'signed mode' and 'unsigned mode.'

Operands A, B, and the result each get two seven-segment displays. The left and right displays are configured within the operand-result interpreter or 'ORI' block. Three signals feed into the ORI: input, op code, and sign. The 'sign' signal determines whether the ORI operates in signed or unsigned mode. In unsigned mode, the sign display is typically off since it only deals with the magnitude of positive numbers.
In signed mode, the sign display will show either a '$+$' or a '$-$' symbol to indicate the sign of the number. This is relevant when working with Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), a system for representing decimal numbers in binary format.

When adding 9 and 1 in BCD, you have a carry. The maximum value that you can show is $F$. What happens with these displays is the choice you have to make. Since you will be doing all calculations in binary, the operand-result interpreter takes over and will decide what the value is. Your arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, has some basic building blocks you want to decide on how to display.

When you are calculating BCD, $9+1$ is 0 with a carry. That has a lot to do with how the seven-segment display works. Instead of designing the system so that it shows all digits between 0 and F, the op code needs to tell us to calculate only BCD digits. Thus, when you get above 9 you need to display '1' on the carry bit. With four bits, the highest possible value is 15, so you will always have to make the choice of displaying 1.

But how do you seek to sign model? Then the most significant bit of the nibble has the weight of $-2^3$ or $-8$.
This creates a design decision. You could make your code simpler to display a $+$, $-$, or empty sign to show the result.

The operation of the provided circuit, dubbed the 'ORI', receives an input, an opcode, and a sign. The circuit produces two displays: a left display and a right display. The display shows a two-digit number. The left digit represents the sign ($+/-$ or $+/1$) and the right digit is the magnitude (ranging from 0 to F).

The subject matter then turns to the overflow, and how to make the overflow visible during an arithmetic operation. If you have four bits to represent a number, you often need an extra bit to capture the result of the operation. If four bits are added to four bits, it may require five bits to capture the entire result. The fifth bit, typically a zero in this context, serves as an overflow indicator. So, one extra bit is added before the bits used for calculation, making it `$0xxx + 0xxx = xxxxx$` where the leftmost `$x$` can indicate overflow. The overflow bit becomes the bit that is not shown. For example, if you are adding two values represented by 4 bits, you will need a fifth bit on the result to catch the overflow bit. The bits that are exported out of the arithmetic unit are typically 5 and are needed to show overflow. In the presented model a zero is normally put in place.

The discussion then shifts towards handling the entity block in the hardware description and design of Very-high-speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL). It is emphasised that altering the entity block can lead to problems across other modules in a design. Other modules are connected expecting a certain set of inputs and outputs, or *ports*, as defined in the entity block. Changing the entity block will propagate throughout your design, therefore be careful when altering your entity block.

The flag handler is responsible for exporting the five bits from the arithmetic unit, which helps to determine if there's an overflow. The discussed flag register consists of flags like Zero (Z), Auxiliary Carry (A), Carry (C), and Sign (S), often presented in this order. The presenter then corrects the order which is Frg (flag register) Z, A, C, Sign. If a sign bit is set to one, that indicates sign handling is being used. There will also be a carry if an overflow takes place. During arithmetic calculation if there are $n$ zero-valued results, then the Zero flag is set. It is highlighted that there can be significant sloppiness when dealing with plus and minus. All this happens very much automatically.

It is stated there is no *signed mode* in a logic function; instead you just manipulate the bits, not a sign. If your op-code is in sign mode, it makes the sign function go off. In VHDL design, this is all done in a specific environment. The presenter states to remember that altering or changing a VHDL entity block has impacts to the wider connected ports, which can be problematic if not done carefully, with thoroughness and attention to the impacts to the connecting functions and modules. Overall, a number of these aspects should fall into place quickly, where you should be able to handle such circumstances, quickly resolving design elements as you proceed.

In VHDL, when dealing with concurrent versus sequential code, consider this: a signal like 'a' cannot be assigned a value twice in concurrent code. This is because concurrent statements describe hardware behavior, where multiple actions happen simultaneously. Assigning 'a' a value in two different lines would mean trying to drive the same hardware signal from two places, which is not allowed and will result in a "multiple drivers" error during compilation. Think of it like trying to control a lightbulb with two switches â€“ which one is actually controlling it?

However, if the code is *sequential* (as it would be inside a PROCESS block), then the assignments happen one after the other. Let's analyze this sequential code snippet:

```vhdl
SIGNAL a, b, c : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 DOWNTO 0) := "0000";
a <= "0100";
c <= a;
b <= "0101";
a <= b;
```

Here's how the value of signal 'a' changes step-by-step:

1. First, signals `a`, `b`, and `c` are created and initialized to `"0000"`.
2. Then, `a` is assigned the value `"0100"`.
3. `c` is assigned the current value of `a`, which is `"0100"`. `a` and `c` now hold the value `"0100"`.
4. `b` is assigned the value `"0101"`. `b` now holds the value `"0101"`.
5. Finally, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, which is `"0101"`. Therefore, `a` now holds the value `"0101"`. `c` still holds the value `"0100"`.

Thus, the last value assigned to the signal `a` is `"0101"`. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Now, let's discuss WHEN statements in VHDL. Consider a signal `q` of type `STD_LOGIC` that is initially `'1'`. Here are two code snippets using WHEN statements:

**Left Code:**

```vhdl
q <= '0' WHEN rst = '1' ELSE
     d   WHEN clk = '1';
```

**Right Code:**

```vhdl
q <= '0' WHEN rst = '1' ELSE
     d   WHEN clk = '1' ELSE
     '1';   -- UNAFFECTED
```

Assume `rst = '0'` and `clk = '0'`. What are the values of `q` in the left and right codes, respectively?

*   **Left Code Analysis:** Because `rst` is `'0'`, the first condition (`rst = '1'`) is false. Therefore, the `ELSE` clause is executed. In this `ELSE` clause, the condition `clk = '1'` is checked. Because `clk` is also `'0'`, this condition is false too. When none of WHEN are applied due to the falsity, it's not clear what value will be taken.

*   **Right Code Analysis:** Again, because `rst` is `'0'`, the first condition is false, and the `ELSE` clause is executed. Inside the `ELSE` clause, the `clk = '1'` condition is checked and found to be false. Thus, the *innermost* `ELSE` clause which assigns `'1'` to `q` is executed, explicitly retaining the original value. Therefore, `q` remains unaffected. Thus the right value is `unaffected`.

Therefore, the answer is D, "none of the above" since q does not have a new value assigned for the left case, while the right case has q as 'unaffected'.

Finally, let's look at Structural VHDL. Structural VHDL involves describing a design by connecting pre-defined components. Component instantiation (creating an instance of a component and placing it in the design) is a *concurrent* statement. Component instantiation is typically done at the top level of a design. Structural VHDL emphasizes assembling a design using these component instances rather than describing the low-level behavior directly. Instead of designing everything from scratch, you reuse already-made and tested blocks. It's akin to building a circuit board, you select individual chips (components) and connect them as per your design. You can also use multiple entities. For structural VHDL, VHDL code is structured into library block, entity block, and architecture block. The multiple entities within a single VHDL file requires having the same library block in the file. The architecture block includes the signals to interconnect, describing the functionality of hardware and concurrency (or sequencing if needed). Also it requires having a port map of the component with the signal description on what output maps what input.

This section explains a System on a Chip (SOC) component example, specifically a clock domain crossing. This involves understanding how signals pass between different parts of a system clocked by separate, potentially asynchronous clocks. The explanation starts with a circuit diagram showing interconnected flip-flops. The output of one flip-flop is fed into the input of another. This particular setup implements clock domain crossing.

If this complex circuit is collapsed into a single block, you can visualize it as a clock domain crossing component. This component has inputs like the keyboard clock (`kbclock`), a general clock (`clk`), keyboard data (`kbdata`), and reset (`reset`). These inputs feed into the component, and then it outputs signals like the keyboard clock synchronized signal (`kbclocksync`) and keyboard data synchronized signal (`kbdatasync`). The idea is to encapsulate this clock domain crossing logic into a manageable, reusable block. This makes the code easier to control and maintain, breaking down the design into smaller, more manageable parts.

Since VHDL '93, it is not necessary to use VHDL components. You can instantiate the ENTITY directly from a file. To do this, you add the `.vhd` file in Quartus to your current project. This way, you're treating each component as a separate file, similar to how header and implementation files are handled in C programming.

An example of instantiating an ENTITY from a file is when an `ENTITY seg7dec` (a 7-segment decoder) is instantiated six times. The architecture section of the VHDL code describes the structure of an "orgeltje". Inside the `BEGIN` block, there are instantiations for six 7-segment displays, labeled as `hexDisplay0`, `hexDisplay1`, `hexDisplay2`, `hexDisplay3`, `hexDisplay4`, and `hexDisplay5`. Each of these displays is connected to the `work.sevenOut4Decoder` component using a `port map`. Each display connects to its respective signal (e.g., `hexSignal0`, `dotSignal0`, `control0`, and `HEX0` for `hexDisplay0`).

`Work` is one of the default libraries, and it is not necessary to specifically declare its location in your project. The compiler looks for all entities in the project, specifically by name (`ENTITY seg7dec`) and then hooks them up to the right signals using port maps. Structural VHDL involves creating multiple entities within an ALU. There are visible blocks and, crucially, that multi-bit buses are handled to reduce complexity. Entities in the design are interconnected, forming a hierarchy of modules.

Each task needs to compile without warnings or errors for your work to get grading approval. Compiling without warnings and errors means your project has a higher probability of working correctly. Once your code compiles cleanly, view the Register Transfer Level (RTL) viewer to validate your design. By inspecting this view you can verify correct behaviour and see what component needs what from where. This ensures that your design is working in the correct way. If, after adding a module, you see extra unwanted elements, that's a sign you should check. When laying-out a design for evaluation, a clean schematic of the ALU with identified logic components, is what should be visible.
