# VHDL and Test Benches: Sequential Coding and Verification
## Utilizing ModelSim, Quartus, and Catch2 for Hardware Description Language Design

This lesson focuses on the second period and third phase in which Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is further explored along with sequential coding. Key takeaways for this period involve successfully completing test benches and recognizing that both exercises and theoretical content play a significant role. The assessment for this phase involves submitting the release of the Git repository through HandIn by week 17 before 9:00 AM. Following this, in week 18, students will undergo oral assessment which also determines whether a team with deferred submission for sprint 2 will be granted. Students also learn that to get the best grade, they need to be proficient on their own rather than relying excessively on external assistance. Emphasis is placed on effectively managing workloads since there are various holidays approaching along with lessons being moved around such as King's Day.

The material that will be needed include a book: Pedroni circuit Design and Simulation with VHDL; Onderwijs Online lecture presentations, powerpoints and Examples (https://gitlab.com/wlgrw/han-soc-examples). Also, it is added assignment document 2, assignment rubrics, DE10-lite board (PS/2-shield) and assignment form. Furthermore, since there will no longer be an explicit discussion about the theoretical side of this phase going forward, you will need to rely on self-studying to close any gaps that you may have. This period is a lesson-free week to let the information that has been covered sink in.

The lecture will cover the material that will be required in test benches and that involves working ModelSim and making sure that the code is compatible on the software. The testbenches cover material from concurrent to sequential logic, and the next sprint focuses on the cyclyzer. Because it has been identified that cyclyzer code can only be properly understood by constructing concurrent logic the first lessons provide a critical foundation for upcoming ones. Lastly, students that have completed their exams will receive feedback as to how they did so that they have all of the material that is required to proceed to the following portion of the course.

This is a summary of the system on a chip class materials, specifically relating to sequential VHDL. The DE10-lite board (with PS/2-shield) will be used. The examples can be found on GitLab. Sequential code is necessary for piano code because you need to make frequency dividers and counters. To make cyclical logic, concurrent logic will be placed on top. The assignments for this week include System on Chip tentamen, D-H-SOC-T and System on Chip opdracht, D-H-SOC-O. The second assignment involves creating a piano in VHDL. Students will use a GitLab repository. The DE10-lite board (with PS/2-shield) and a PS/2 keyboard will be used. The architecture should be modular, using structural VHDL. The keyboard connects to the Read Key component. This then connects to displays 1-4 and the Tone Generation, which itself goes to audio output. Note that there is a speaker on the board. This means that the tones of the piano can actually be generated. The upper row of keys ('qwerty') become the black piano keys and the 'asdf' row the white piano keys. This means a melody can be played on the keyboard.

A `PROCESS` is a concurrent block that describes behavior in a sequential manner. Multiple process blocks run concurrently. The process block contains the Clock generator, optional sensitivity list, variable declarations, the 'begin' keyword and the 'sequential' activities ending with `END PROCESS clock_process;`. Remember to include only the necessary input signals in the sensitivity list for your process execution to be started. Leaving out the sensitivity list requires the use of a wait statement (i.e., `wait until`). It can be best to have it all in one process block to achieve a consistent code style. There are some benefits in putting components together for concurrent code. For the PS/2 keyboard, there is a Scan Code (not ASCII), where the keystrokes are scanned. For example, pressing 5 keys generates 5 scan codes. This applies to release and depress events.

A `PROCESS` in VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) is a concurrent block that describes how a circuit behaves in a sequential or step-by-step manner. Multiple `PROCESS` blocks can run at the same time, which is called running concurrently. This means you can describe parallel operations happening at once, even though within each process, the operations are described in order.

The general structure of a `PROCESS` looks like this:

*   First, there's a comment indicating that it's a clock generator. Then comes the `PROCESS` declaration: `clock_process : PROCESS`.
*   A key element is the optional sensitivity list, which dictates when the `PROCESS` will execute. This list contains signals. The `PROCESS` is sensitive to any changes on a signal listed in this list. The sensitivity list is represented as `(-- optional sensitivity list --)`.
*   There will be variable declarations declared before the process begins.
*   Then, the core part starts with `BEGIN`. Inside the `BEGIN` block, you define the sequential activities or steps that the `PROCESS` will perform. This area is labeled `(-- "sequential" activities --)`.
*   Finally, the `PROCESS` ends with `END PROCESS clock_process;`.

Using `PROCESS` blocks allows you to describe concurrent behavior in a structural way. The language VHDL also has Verilog, which is similar to VHDL but in Verilog, everything is described in a sequential manner. With two coexisting coding styles in VHDL, there are certain arguments on how to make it consistent. Some complex constructions are less prone to errors in the process block coding style. This consistency avoids a fault.

Test benches play an important part in the code to verify the expected behavior of code in VHDL. When making a test bench for code, it is important to know the expected output. A test bench generates the inputs and checks if those inputs and the resultant output matches the expected output from the process block. A robust code would also check to see what the response is from error inputs, such as crash cases.

To prepare for creating a testbench in Quartus, certain preliminary checks are needed. First, in the settings, go to the Simulation options. Next, verify that the 'Output directory' is set to 'simulation/modelsim'. Finally, click OK to save these settings. It is also important to check that ModelSim is correctly configured so that Quartus can locate it. In version 19 of Quartus, ModelSim is included, but the installation script might not always configure it correctly. To check this, navigate to Tools and then Options. In the options window, select 'EDA Tool Options'. Here you need to verify the path for ModelSim; typically, the ModelSim path should read as 'C:/intelFPGA_lite/[your version number]/modelsim_ase/win32aloem/modelsim.exe.' If this path isn't correctly set, ModelSim may not work, even if installed.

To create a testbench, first open your VHDL code in Quartus. Then navigate to Processing, Start, and finally, select 'Start Test Bench Template Writer'. This will generate a template file, which is a very basic testbench setup, looking at your opened VHDL code which represents a component, and creates a testbench based on that component's inputs and outputs. This generated testbench will be stored by default within your project folder, in a subfolder: 'simulation/modelsim'. Next, copy the generated testbench file (e.g., 'example\_nbit\_divider.vht') to your project folder. Then rename the testbench file, adding '\_tb' before the '.vhd' extension (e.g., 'example\_nbit\_divider\_tb.vhd'). Next open your newly created testbench file (e.g. 'example\_fsm\_tb.vhd') and import that into your project and be sure to check the "Add file to current project" box. When working with ModelSim, this becomes your top-level entity. By adding code into the testbench, one can configure constants like `clockPeriod` and `resetDelay`, as in:

```latex
ARCHITECTURE fsm_example_arch OF fsm_example_tb IS
-- constants
CONSTANT clockPeriod : TIME := 10 ps;
CONSTANT resetDelay : TIME := 30 ps;
-- signals
--signals to connect to DUT
BEGIN
-- Clock generator
clock_process : process
begin
clk <= '0';
wait for clockPeriod * 0.75;
clk <= '1';
wait for clockPeriod * 0.25;
end process clock_process;
END fsm_example_arch;
```

Here `clk` is set to '0' initially, and then there is a wait for 75% of the clock period, after which `clk` is set to '1' and the process waits for the other 25%. The resulting clock is a clock with a duty cycle that is *not* 50/50. If a symmetrical clock is desired with equal high and low time periods, set both processes to wait for $clockPeriod*0.5$. This testbench code creates a clock with a 50/50 duty cycle, where a 'wait' statement (which is not synthesizable) is used. Since this is a testbench, however, we are performing functional testing, rather than timing tests. Also you use it to connect component(s) to this testbench using "instantiation".

To find the tab size settings in the Quartus Prime Lite edition text editor, navigate to the Options menu. Within the Options menu, locate the "Text Editor" settings. Here, you'll find a field labeled "Tab size (in spaces)". This setting lets you specify the number of spaces that a tab character will represent, which affects the indentation level in your code. You can customize the number of spaces to your preferred coding style. For example, the tab size can be set to 3 spaces. Additionally, ensure the “Insert space on Tab” box is checked to insert spaces when the tab key is pressed.

To replace tabs with spaces quickly within the editor, use the shortcut Ctrl+H to open the "Replace" dialog. In the "Find" field enter a tab and in the "Replace" field, enter the desired number of spaces (e.g. 3 spaces).

When working in the Quartus environment and editing VHDL code, you'll encounter specific code blocks or sections, like the Library block, the Entity block, the Architecture block, and the End Architecture block. In the Architecture block you find the Begin and End Component, constants, and signals. These blocks define the structure and behavior of your hardware design. The Port Map block lists the connections between the master ports and signals, mapping the component's input and output signals to the corresponding signals in your top-level design.

An 'init process' in VHDL is a section of code that executes only once at the start of the simulation. For example,

```vhd
Init: PROCESS
   BEGIN
     -- code that executes only once
     reset <= '0';
     max_count <= "00000011";  -- Binary for 3
     WAIT for ClockPeriod*10;
     reset <= '1';
   END PROCESS Init;
```

In this 'init process' example, at time zero of the simulation, the reset signal is set to `'0'`. The max_count, which determines the upper limit of a counter, is set to the binary value "00000011", representing the decimal number 3. The system then waits for 10 clock cycles using `WAIT for ClockPeriod*10;`. After this delay, the reset signal is set to `'1'`. This makes the reset signal active at simulation time zero for a certain clock period. This 'init process' also interacts with another process, `Clock_process`, which generates the clock signal essential for the digital circuit's operation. The architecture has two sets of stimulis that are created. The Library, Entity, Architecture, Signals and Begin/End Component are selected, and are used to explain, for example, the code that executes only once at the start. This is used to make the reset line active at simulation time zero, or time equal to 0, for a certain clock period. In another code block, the `clock_process` begins immediately, defining clock as equal to 0 for a clock period equal to 0.5. Because you're telling the system to wait for a particular time or event, or to continue executing based on the sensitivity list. This sets it up so it will immediately begin to execute the process. This 'always' process for generating the clock signal.

The steps for working with ModelSim include:

1.  First, you have to Compile the project which will create a work library. The Library is where the project will simulate and has an example and tb (test bench).
2.  Then start with Simulation which leads you to the design.

The ModelSim tool is described as more advanced but also unstable. It’s not uncommon for the ModelSim window to crash sometimes. It is then shown how to add components by using these commands. The user has two main choices, the VHDL version and test bench. The test bench is the program, which also compiles. You can also simulate gate level versions in the tools but these steps were not detailed in the summary. Then it goes onto to explaining how to setup the ModelSim window environment.

To set up ModelSim, a couple of steps were taken to do this successfully. Some versions may need to be used when certain constructions are needed. In this case, the user needs to specify the correct version before using ModelSim. The user then has two source designs.

Then ModelSim needs a way to create that simulation. The "Run Length" is where you set the run time for the Simulation and the Run the Code command. You must then insert all the appropriate data to see when the Reset and Data is correct. Set the appropriate "Run Length", and begin testing the setup in the program ModelSim.

Setting up ModelSim requires some steps to be implemented, but is a vital way to program any coding that may be taking place.

Catch2 is a popular test framework you can use to perform assertions and test a case. A test case is where you call a function with a known input and a known output. The Catch2 test framework listens to see if the result matches. As an example of this, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) was used with students. CRC checks are used to ensure that information sent is received correctly. A test bench was created so that information could be sent with a CRC to test with the students. The CRC that was implemented was tested but it wasn't initially clear what type of CRC it was. This required examining the documentation to see what it actually did, what polynomial was used, and what seed was used.

The test bench built for that CRC became reproducible, which meant students could use the code and the test bench would immediately show them that it worked. This ensures that the code is good and works as expected. Having a test bench makes code transferable, so someone working on it later can immediately check that any changes don't break the original functionality. A waveform simulator is a simplified way to begin testing.

When making a test bench, like one made for an ALU, each function needs its own test case. For example, for multiplication one would make one test case. The test bench should go through these cases. Then at the end it checks if the output is what's expected. For instance, $1 + 1 = 2$. Finally, it writes a file stating whether the test case was true or false. With more advanced testing techniques, the tests can be much more robust. Ultimately, it is necessary to describe each situation to be tested. For addition, you need an "add" test case and a test case for two's complement, where, for example, $7 + 1 = -8$.

This test bench then operates on an array of structs. In each struct are all the input and output values. The test bench loops through them to execute the function. The order and timing are the same, regardless of the input. This then allows for an array of test cases. It's good to have about 30 different tests run and then to output a report to disk to review the results. A logic analyzer helps with this process. It can show functional phase faults in a frequency divider. One can test it until 10 to see the fault. A 1-0 fault can trigger different behaviors depending on the test case. To test more accurately, one may need to run the simulation at picosecond resolution, even when the application works at microsecond resolution. When using this methodology, it becomes clear what is happening with the code.
