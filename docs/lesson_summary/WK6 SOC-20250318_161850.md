# VHDL Coding: Sequential vs. Concurrent Logic and Debugging

## Understanding VHDL Concepts, Type Conversion, and Practical Debugging Strategies for SoC Projects

In this lesson, the focus is on understanding sequential code, particularly how it applies to VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The primary assignment for students involves working with concurrent code for a specific task; however, one specific section of the assignment requires sequential code. This section pertains to an end-bit buffer that is listed at the end of the assigned lab activities. The key point being that the remainder of the assignment **must be completed using concurrent code.**

The assignment entails connecting two LEDs in series. While achieving the desired outcome with concurrent code is possible for the purpose of understanding how concurrent coding works, doing so is not practical for real world applications. In practice, a flip-flop is made with sequential code, which you'll learn about in this lesson.

It's also mentioned that students should check that they have signed up for both SOC (System on a Chip) assignment one and two inside the Osiris system to receive proper credit.

Crucially, it's emphasized that if any sequential code is found anywhere besides the specified end-bit buffer task within SOC assignment one, it will be returned for correction. This underscores the importance of understanding when and where sequential versus concurrent coding is appropriate. All parts related to the flip-flop creation should be done with sequential code in the proper location.

It is important to generate a clean export from your Git repository without any extra files or folders for your assignment submissions. Since Quartus generates a lot of files, a release should be created which is a ZIP archive with limited files and folders. A clone from a GitHub repository or download from the GitLab Web interface results in clean source files, and the subsequent .zip archives are what should be handed in. Use a student number with both team member student numbers separated with a 'greater than' symbol in between (e.g., student1>student2). Check GitHub and the Practical Manual to see if there is an update of your remote. This will affect what code you should check into your code to make it a perfect and valid assignment submission. Remember that you must work with your team member on which of your two changes to accept or reject in case there are any code conflicts on the current version on the remote. The correct approach is to perform local stashing, new pulling, and then merging your stashed code back into the local repo before pushing to the remote repository and then working further to resolve your conflicts. The remote will have the more recent and correct source code version with correct assignments.

This segment explains the solution to a digital logic question involving logical operators and bit vectors in VHDL code, followed by the concept of shift right arithmetic.

The initial problem involves determining the values of two signals, 'c' and 'd', after specific operations. The signals 'a' and 'b' are first defined as bit vectors and assigned initial values: 'a' is an 8-bit vector set to "00111100", and 'b' is a 4-bit vector set to "0111". The question then provides VHDL code that assigns values to signals 'c' and 'd' based on logical operations. The assignment to 'c' involves a NAND operation between a portion of 'a' (bits 7 down to 4, or the leftmost four bits) and the constant "0111". The signal 'd' is assigned based on an XNOR operation of 'b' (bits 2 down to 0) with the constant "101". The correct answers for 'c' and 'd' are "1100" and "101" respectively, resulting from evaluating the NAND and XNOR logic gates. The question highlights the importance of understanding the bit vector sizes involved in these operations. It also notes that the VHDL code initialises signals, so that any unconnected outputs effectively are initialised.

The next step involves an explanation of how to work out the answers. First the sizes of the vectors are noted: 'a' is 8 bits long, 'b', 'c' and 'd' are four bits long. The solution first considers the NAND operation. It notes that in the assignment `c <= a(7 DOWNTO 4) NAND "0111";`, the bits 7 DOWNTO 4 of vector `a` which are used, are the leftmost or most significant bits. These are `0011`. These are then NANDed with `0111`. NAND is equivalent to AND, followed by NOT. `0011` AND `0111` is `0011`. Then the inverse (NOT) is `1100`, giving the value of `c` as `1100`.

The problem then considers `d <= b(2 DOWNTO 0) XNOR "101";`. It is first noted that `b` is `0111`. The rightmost 3 bits are taken - `111` and these are XNORed with `101`. The XNOR operation returns 1 only when both inputs are the same. Thus 1 XNOR 1 is 1, 1 XNOR 0 is 0, and 1 XNOR 1 is 1, so `d` is `101`.

Therefore, `c = 1100` and `d = 101`.

Next, the concept of shift right arithmetic (SRA) is introduced with an example. In a shift right arithmetic operation, everything shifts to the right. More specifically, in VHDL shift right arithmetic, the leftmost bit of the vector is duplicated. If you have the bit vector, `00111100`, and shift it two positions to the right using the SRA, it shifts the original numbers to the right: you have to start to fill bits to the left and after 2 steps to the left we get '11' and '111100'. This segment therefore generates `111100` so the new value starts with '11'. The most significant bit (`x(5)`) is set to '1', and using concatenation you can achieve that using `y <= x(5) & x(5) & x(5 DOWNTO 2);`. It's stressed that when there are bits missing in this process, it is important to add in a 0 initialisation of unconnected outputs to ensure that everything is a standard definition. Itâ€™s then stated that the right answer can be given in the initial VHDL by changing to the function `SLA` (shift left arithmetical). By using the right naming conventions it is easier to know the result.

Type conversion allows signals to be converted for compatibility. There are three methods in VHDL: qualified expressions, typecasting, and conversion functions.

A qualified expression explicitly states the type of an expression and is necessary when the type might be ambiguous. For instance, `"0010"` could be interpreted as a string, a bit vector, or an `std_logic_vector`. To avoid ambiguity, qualified expressions specify the type, e.g., `string'("0010")`, `bit_vector'("0010")`, or `std_logic_vector'("0010")`.

Typecasting involves converting from one type to another; for numeric types it is implemented with functions such as `to_integer()`, `to_unsigned()`, and `to_signed()`. For example, $to_integer(S)$ converts a signed value $S$ into an integer. Type conversion functions such as this are often available in VHDL packages. For conversion from integers to other types, use functions such as $unsigned(I, J'length)$, which converts an integer $I$ into an unsigned vector with a length defined by $J'length$. Similarly, the function $signed(I, J'length)$ can be used to convert an integer into a signed value with a specified length.

To be able to use these functions, include the appropriate library with the command `LIBRARY-block`.

Regarding concurrent and sequential logic in VHDL, concurrent statements are signal assignments within the architecture but outside any `PROCESS` construct. These are also called concurrent assignments or concurrent processes. In VHDL, everything outside a process is concurrent. The delay between the input and output in concurrent logic is only the propagation delay, and the behavior can be described logically, such as $C = A \text{ AND } B$.

Sequential logic, however, exists within a `PROCESS` block. In this case, the delay between input and output is also the propagation delay but behavior must be described sequentially, for instance using if/then statements. Changes on inputs within sequential logic are acted upon when they are in a specified "watchlist" (sensitivity list).
A `PROCESS` block in VHDL is a concurrent block that describes behavior in a sequential manner. Multiple `PROCESS` blocks may run concurrently. The structure begins with `process_name : PROCESS` followed by an optional sensitivity list. Inside the `PROCESS` block, signals, variables, and constants are declared. After the `BEGIN` statement, the sequential activities are described, ending with `END PROCESS process_name;`.

When implementing rising-edge detection using `std_logic`, consider these two VHDL implementations:

*   Implementation 1:

    ```vhdl
    PROCESS (clk)
    BEGIN
    IF (clk'EVENT AND clk = '1') THEN
        d <= input;
    END IF;
    END PROCESS;
    ```

*   Implementation 2:

    ```vhdl
    PROCESS (clk)
    BEGIN
    IF (rising_edge(clk)) THEN
        d <= input;
    END IF;
    END PROCESS;
    ```

While both may seem equivalent, using $STD\_LOGIC$, implementation 1 can produce undesired results`, which is why implementation 2 is the better choice. This is because with $clk'EVENT \text{ AND } clk = '1'$, where `clk` can transition from an undefined state (like 'U' or 'X') to '1', the condition will be true and it triggers incorrect behavior, which won't happen if the other method is used.

---

Rising-edge detection can be implemented in two ways. The first implementation involves using the clock's `'EVENT` and checking if the clock value is `'1'`. In this case, if `clk'EVENT AND clk = '1'` then `d <= input`. The second implementation uses a function `rising_edge(clk)`. If `rising_edge(clk)` is true, then `d <= input`.

When using `STD_LOGIC`, the first implementation can produce undesirable results. The reason is that when using `STD_LOGIC`, going from something undefined to a `'1'` is considered an event. `STD_LOGIC` has nine possible values. If eight of those nine values ended in `'1'`, they are considered an event. A `'1'` is comparable to a logical one or high. This means you can see rising edges that are not real edges. Because of this, the `rising_edge` function is better to use than implementation one. The function `rising_edge` can detect a transition from `'0'` to `'1'` in concurrent logic or in a process block. So, while the first implementation might be accepted by a compiler, the second implementation is preferred in practice because it uses the `rising_edge` function.

Regarding concurrent versus sequential logic, the functionalities are the same, but the syntax is different. If-then-else statements and switch-case statements can be used in both. Concurrent logic uses `WHEN ELSE` for if-then-else logic and `WITH ... SELECT` for switch-case logic. Sequential logic uses `IF THEN ELSIF` for if-then-else logic and `CASE x IS` for switch-case logic.

A 4-port multiplexer is an example. It has four inputs (A, B, C, and D), one output (OUT), and one selector (SEL). In concurrent code, you could use `WITH sel SELECT` to assign the appropriate input to `out1` when `sel` is `"00"`, `"01"`, `"10"`, or `"11"`. To ensure all possible values are covered, you should include a `WHEN OTHERS;`. In sequential logic, you can use a `CASE` statement in a `PROCESS` block that lists the same assignments based on the value of `sel`. It is crucial to remember to add all nine possibilities of `STD_LOGIC`.

Therefore, you would write `ARCHITECTURE ... OF ... IS BEGIN out1 <= a WHEN sel = "00" ELSE b WHEN sel = "01" ELSE c WHEN sel = "10" ELSE d WHEN OTHERS; END;` When writing concurrent code.

Therefore, for sequential logic, write `ARCHITECTURE ... OF ... IS BEGIN PROCESS (a, b, c, d, sel) BEGIN IF sel = "00" THEN out1 <= a; ELSIF sel = "01" THEN out1 <= b; ELSIF sel = "10" THEN out1 <= c; ELSE out1 <= d; END IF; END PROCESS; END;`

The key is that when using `STD_LOGIC` and having two bits, you have nine possibilities that must be accounted for. When the possibilities have not been accounted for you receive the error "Error (10313): VHDL Case Statement error at example_1_concurrent_vs_sequential.vhd(101): Case Statement choices must cover all possible values of expression."

---

In VHDL, when writing case statements to implement logic, particularly when working with `standard_logic` or `bit` types, you must ensure that all possible values of the selection expression are covered within the case statement. If you don't cover all the possible values, you'll encounter an error during compilation or simulation. An error like 'Case Statement choices must cover all possible values of expression' appears. This is because VHDL needs to know what to do in every possible scenario to fully control the output.

To address this, you can use the `WHEN OTHERS` clause. This clause acts as a catch-all, specifying what should happen if the selection expression doesn't match any of the explicitly listed cases. So, in concurrent code you'll typically see something like this:

```vhdl
WITH sel SELECT
  out1 <= a WHEN "00",
          b WHEN "01",
          c WHEN "10",
          d WHEN OTHERS;
```

Here, `sel` is the selector signal, and `out1` is assigned `a`, `b`, or `c` based on the value of `sel`. The `WHEN OTHERS` clause ensures that if `sel` is *not* `"00"`, `"01"`, or `"10"`, then `out1` is assigned the value of `d`.

In sequential logic, using a process and a `CASE` statement, the equivalent would be:

```vhdl
PROCESS (a, b, c, d, sel)
BEGIN
  CASE sel IS
    WHEN "00" => out1 <= a;
    WHEN "01" => out1 <= b;
    WHEN "10" => out1 <= c;
    WHEN OTHERS => out1 <= d;
  END CASE;
END PROCESS;
```

Using the `WHEN OTHERS` clause in the concurrent code allows to take control over the possible outputs, and not let any combination be undefined. By addressing 'others', you cover the complete scope, determining what the output should be in every possible situation.

However, whether using `WHEN OTHERS` is always desirable depends on the specific design. If you are seriously programming in VHDL, it is best to work with bit data types within the logic and then only make a conversion to standard logic when interfacing with the outside world, and back again only at the outputs. This strategy reduces this particular type of error. This allows you to achieve a better quality program as this problem appears less often.

When an `IF THEN` statement is used it creates different hardware compared to the use of CASE statements. Likewise using `WHEN ELSE` instead of `WITH SELECT`.

It is important to have a view of what hardware is to be generated by inspecting it with the RTL viewer. When you use the `CASE` statement construct when intending to generate a multiplexer, then make sure you achieve a multiplexer by looking at the results. If a multiplexer is not the result, then there must be something amiss and you would have to work from the point of 'why not'.

Sequential VHDL code is executed line by line, using memory elements, specifically registers to store the internal state. In combinatorial circuits, include all inputs in the sensitivity list within processes. Case statement choices must be mutually exclusive, covering all possible values of the selection expression.

The style in which code is written in VHDL directly impacts the generated hardware and is therefore important. If you want a multiplier, use a CASE statement or something similar, don't use IF THEN ELSIF. By adhering to this principle the quality of generated hardware will be optimal. If, for example, a designer expects a multiplexer, the designer should actively ensure a multiplexer is the design that the code implements, since in an RTL viewer this is easily verified.

The discussion centers on debugging and collaborating on embedded hardware engineering, specifically with System on a Chip (SoC) projects. Key points include the importance of checking files, identifying specific lines that are causing issues, and the potential need to reinstall the USB blaster if problems persist, emphasizing that these problems can be addressed through careful investigation and a systematic approach to debugging to be able to recognize errors rather than ignore them. Pin assignments also need to be carefully checked as they were found to be the core of an issue. Collaboration and discussion with others are highlighted to work in conjunction to discover where mistakes occurred and to resolve them. The video reinforces the idea that issues are inherent to this type of work, and that finding the root causes as opposed to getting frustrated with them are a key part of succeeding.
