# Clock Generation and State Machine Theory in SoC Design
## An Overview of Clock Signals, Counters, PLLs, and Finite State Machines

This lesson provides an overview of clock generation and state machine theory, particularly in the context of System on Chip (SoC) design. A state machine, formally a finite-state machine (FSM), is a mathematical model of computation used to design digital logic. In Dutch, it is referred to as an "eindige afstands machine". If an input changes in a Finite State Machine (FSM), what happens? Depending on the current state, a change of state may occur. In an FSM diagram, an arrow between the states represents a change of state. Finite state machines are not combinational logic systems, but can be implemented in conjunction with this architecture.

The lesson goes into what this might look like with the following topics being discussed:

*   **Clock Generation:** The general handling of clock signals and the mechanisms used to generate and manage these signals.
*   **Ripple Counters:** Counters where the flip-flops are connected in a chain, and the output of one flip-flop triggers the next.
*   **Ring Counters:** Shift registers where the output of the last register is fed back to the input of the first.
*   **Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs):** Feedback control systems that generate an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal.

The activities this week will provide the theory of clock generation, discuss ripple and ring counters, as well as phase lock loops. Then there will be laboratory exercises based upon the material discussed. Clock divider circuits are discussed as a means of generating precise frequencies. Specifically asynchronous (Ripple Counter), synchronous (Johnson Ring Counter) and quadrature generators are described, followed by a discussion of where they are used when synthesizing.

The following key terms are touched upon:

*   **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: A machine with a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions. What happens to an FSM when the input changes is that, depending on the current state, a change of state *may* occur.
*   **State Diagram**: A graphical representation of an FSM, showing states as circles and transitions as arrows. The arrow between the state is a representation of the *change of state*. The initial state of the machine is often given with an arrow pointing to the starting state of the state machine.
*   **State**: A condition that the FSM can be in at any given time.
*   **Transition**: A change from one state to another, triggered by an input.
*   **Sequential Logic**: A type of digital logic circuit whose output depends not only on the present input but also on the sequence of past inputs.
*   **Combinational Logic**: A type of digital logic circuit whose output depends only on the present input. If a Finite State Machine has no synchronous output, then all that output is in combinational logic.
*   **Logical Sufficiency**: The ability to implement any logical function using only a small set of logic gates.
*   **Moore Machine**: A type of FSM whose outputs depend only on its current state.
*   **Mealy Machine**: A type of FSM whose outputs depend on both its current state and its current inputs.

Regarding FSM in VHDL, they are made up of three major process blocks:

*   Input Decoder
*   State Decoder
*   Output Decoder

These major blocks provide the architecture for implementing these state machines. Furthermore, you can create "combinatorial" logic using process blocks by implementing what's known as a *sensitivity list*.

In short, a state machine consists of an input decoder, a state decoder, and an output decoder, but in VHDL all three components are combined into a signal state machine. To create combinatorial logic requires a "sensitivity list" as well. Finite State Machines must always be designed sequentially as its basic operation needs to track current *state*. The lesson stresses the importance of working systematically and thoroughly to avoid errors when creating state machines.

Clock generation involves several methods to divide or manipulate the frequency of a clock signal. A simple method utilizes an asynchronous counter, often referred to as a ripple counter. This acts as a simple divider by $n$, where $n$ is an integer. Another approach involves synchronous counters, such as Johnson ring counters. These function by adding a delay or dividing the frequency. A quadrature generator is used to create phase-shifted clocks. For precise frequency control, Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) synthesizers are used, which are readily available as Intellectual Property (IP) in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). A ripple counter is a series of D flip-flops where the output of one flip-flop serves as the clock input for the next. The inverted output, denoted as $Q'$, of each flip-flop is fed back into its D input. A clock signal serves as the initial input. For the first flip-flop, the $Q$ outputs, Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3, of the flip-flops are the outputs of the counter. The rising edge of the clock signal triggers each flip-flop to change its state, depending on what that state was at initialization. With each rising edge, the flip-flop toggles between 0 and 1 or 1 and 0. In this configuration, each D flip-flop effectively divides the frequency by 2. The initial state of each $Q$ output determines when it will toggle. By observing the output values of $Q0$, $Q1$, $Q2$, and $Q3$, you can generate binary numbers; thus the counter is doing binary counting and frequency division at the same time. This setup can be implemented using Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) for implementation on an FPGA. This involves first, an initialization to set the counter to zero. Then a process increments the counter at each clock pulse. The counter value is then an output as a vector. Also, when the counter reaches a specified value, a signal can toggle. The implementation of an 8-bit counter has a flow chart where after initialization and setting the counter to zero, a process is used which checks if the current count equals a set target count; if false, it increments the counter, and if true, the process toggles the output and resets the counter to zero. With the counter implementation in VHDL, the entity block describes the interface (inputs and outputs) and specifies clock, reset (active low), maximum count of eight bits, and the count, all of which are set to standard logic. Internal to architecture block is the process, which includes asynchronous reset in the `IF` statement followed by a clock edge, and subsequent counting to maximum. After the process you can select the count for the $clkOut$.

A ripple counter clock divider has an internal counter with no ceiling, meaning it doesn't have a maximum limit. The divisions are fixed at a factor of 2. The clock signal comes in, there's a reset input, and a `clkOutSelector` which, in the example given, is set to 4. This lets you choose one of eight output signals for `clkOut`. There's also a debug output for the counter.

In VHDL code, you'll see a with-select statement that is outside a process; this is concurrent logic. The `clkOut` gets assigned the `internalCounter` value of 0 when 'X"0', which is hexadecimal notation for 0, is chosen by the `clkOutSelector`. This is done for all eight possibilities, multiplexing them.

To illustrate, consider a ripple counter with four flip-flops (FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4). The clock signal goes into the first flip-flop (FF1), and the output of each flip-flop is connected to the clock input of the next. Each output (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3) represents a division of the input clock signal by a power of 2. You can then select one of these divided clock signals as your output. This requires a multiplexer after the ripple counter, and with the multiplexer, one of the four, or in other cases eight, different signals is chosen to then function as the clock divider.

A simulation of a ripple-counter clock divider shows the clock signal being counted through each successive count. By selecting the output and changing the `clkOutSelector` between 2 and 3, for instance, it is visible on the waveform that you go to a signal with a lower frequency. The output selector chooses from this signal.

In the VHDL implementation of an n-bit clock divider, the internal counter is limited to n, and divisions are variable from 1 to $\frac{1}{n}$ where n is less than or equal to the maximum range, `maxCount`. The basic function is a counter that is incremented at each clock pulse. The input here is an 'N-value' and two types of output can result. The counter value can be output as a vector, or when the counter reaches a value a signal can be toggled.
In practice with a counter implemented this way, you wouldn't get flip-flops of any kind. You can also build this with flip-flops; that is acceptable as well.

When using ripple counters, remember that frequencies with a fraction cannot be generated exactly and will be slightly off, suffering from jitter due to the way they are quantified. Frequencies with a significant divisor are less 'off-frequency' than others.

A phase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizer's main function is to create a frequency that is phase-locked with a reference frequency but at a much higher frequency, even into the GHz range. You can adjust the reference oscillator, but a more important adjustment is the circuit design.

The goal is to generate a frequency that has the same phase as a reference frequency, but at a significantly higher frequency. This can be in the $\text{GHz}$ range. This means that when you have a reference frequency, you can create a frequency that is phase-aligned but much higher.

A phase-locked loop consists of several key components: a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a reference oscillator, a phase comparator, a low-pass filter, and a divider. The VCO is an oscillator whose frequency can be changed by altering the voltage applied to it. This is done using a varactor, which is symbolized as a diode with a line through it. A varactor is basically a capacitor where the capacitance can be varied by changing the reverse voltage across the diode. By using an inductor $L$ and this voltage-controlled capacitor $C$, a parallel filter can be made that creates a variable resonant frequency, and thus a variable oscillator.

The output from the voltage controlled oscillator is fed back through a divider $1/n$ and then to the phase comparator, so that it is in line with reference oscillator.

At one extreme, the system is very stable. At the other extreme, it's super inaccurate, resulting in a free-running frequency. The quality of the components affect by how much $\text{MHz}$ it varies, and it's often affected by temperature changes.

The signal that comes out of the voltage controlled oscillator is fed back into the circuit. This signal is then run through a divider. For example, if the voltage controlled oscillator's frequency is $100 \text{ MHz}$, and the divider is set to $1/100$, then the output going to the phase comparator will be $1 \text{ MHz}$.

This $1 \text{ MHz}$ signal is then fed into the phase comparator, which also takes the reference frequency as an input. A key is a very accurate, stable and temperature-stable crystal reference.

The aim is to phase compare an input signal with the reference signal. In the event it runs ahead of the other then there is a DC voltage signal that's amplified and filtered. This is then fed to the varactor changing its capacitance, which then modifies its resonant frequency.

A common standard is Cesium.
GPS satellites have at least three Cesium standards on board, since time is crucial to its trilateration calculations. The GPS system consists of GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and other such systems.
