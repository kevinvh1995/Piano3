# VHDL Objects, Data Types, and Version Control with Git

## Understanding VHDL Constants, Signals, Data Types, and Best Practices for Git Version Control

This lesson covers VHDL objects and data types, emphasizing the importance of understanding constants and signals within VHDL code. A signal is a variable that can change, similar to wires in a circuit, while a constant is a value that doesn't change after it has been set or initialized. Constants and signals can use any valid VHDL data type.

Constants and signals are declared within specific blocks in the VHDL code: the `ENTITY` and the `ARCHITECTURE` blocks. Let's look at some examples of data types. The basic data type of a single bit of information is a `bit`. When we need to manage a *series* of bits, we can create a `bit_vector` which functions as an array of `bit` values. VHDL also has `std_logic` as a data type. We can see how `CONSTANT` objects can be defined:

```vhdl
GENERIC (
    CONSTANT bits : integer := 16;
    CONSTANT mask : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 DOWNTO 0) := (OTHERS => '0');
    CONSTANT n : integer := 4
    );
PORT (
    clk : IN STD_LOGIC;
    input : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(n-1 DOWNTO 0)
    );
```

In the example code, a `mask` is defined as a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR` of a certain width. In this code example you define, inside the entity block as a generic, the number of "bits" as a constant integer with a value of 16. Similarly, "n" is defined to be a constant integer of "4". The constant "mask" is a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR` of length 8 (7 DOWNTO 0). It uses an aggregate to set every bit in that vector to '0'. You will commonly use IEEE libraries and also standard ones as well and that `STD_LOGIC` is a standard one to utilize for VHDL programming.

The port area for this VHDL module defines "clk" to be an input of type `STD_LOGIC` – meaning a single digital bit – and "input" to be an input of type `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR` with the number of bits defined by the constant "n" (defined in the generics area). You find these constants in the `ENTITY` but not in the `ARCHITECTURE` block. In the `ENTITY` block, a `GENERIC` is a list.

When dealing with vectors in VHDL, it's important to remember the direction (to or downto) and how that impacts the bit order. It also includes defining `LIBRARY` and `USE` statements, such as:

```vhdl
LIBRARY ieee;
USE ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
```

Key things to consider are whether VHDL elements should be declared or written in capital letters, and indentation is used to improve code readability. For good coding style it's useful to have code indentation for code readability and declaring all signals on a separate line.

Regarding IEEE libraries, when using $STD\_LOGIC\_1164$, the industry standard, then those libraries are not visible by default but the library is visible by default and shall be declared where required.

VHDL uses `CONSTANT` and `SIGNAL` objects, which can be of any valid VHDL type. They are declared in the declarative part of the `ENTITY` and `ARCHITECTURE` blocks.  Here's an example of how constants are defined in the `GENERIC` part of an entity:

```vhdl
GENERIC (
    CONSTANT bits : integer := 16;
    CONSTANT mask : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0) := (OTHERS => '0');
    CONSTANT n : integer := 4
);
```

Here, `bits`, `mask`, and `n` are constants of type integer or `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR`, initialized with specific values. Ports are defined within the `PORT` section of the entity. For example:

```vhdl
PORT (
    clk : IN STD_LOGIC;
    input : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(n-1 DOWNTO 0)
);
```

This defines a clock input `clk` as a single bit of standard logic, and an input `input` as a standard logic vector whose size depends on the constant `n` defined in the generic section. Note that when you list a series of constants or ports, you must put a semi-colon after each line *except* for the last item in the list. The last one is not followed by a semi-colon.

Signals are used to pass values in and out of a circuit, and between units. They are declared in the declarative part of the `ENTITY` and `ARCHITECTURE` block, just as constants. Here's an example of signal declarations:

```vhdl
SIGNAL wire : STD_LOGIC;
SIGNAL transfer : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(4 DOWNTO 0);
SIGNAL data : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(4 DOWNTO 0) := (OTHERS => '0');
```

This example shows three signals: `wire`, a single-bit standard logic signal; `transfer`, a 5-bit standard logic vector; and `data`, a 5-bit standard logic vector initialized with all bits set to '0'. Signals represent the "wires" inside your chip connecting the different components.  When using signals, it is important to assign an initial value so you know what state you are in. Signals that do not have an initialization value are in an "unknown" state.

In VHDL, values are assigned to `SIGNAL` objects using the `<=` assignment operator.  For example: `sig <= 5;`. For a `VARIABLE`, values are assigned using the `:=` operator: `var := 5;`.

Signals and variables have key differences: a SIGNAL is a wire, whereas a VARIABLE is a logical entity used *only* within a `PROCESS` block.

```vhdl
SIGNAL wire : STD_LOGIC;
VARIABLE i : INTEGER RANGE 0 TO 3;
SIGNAL data : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 DOWNTO 0) := (OTHERS => '0');
```

Then, to assign the values:

```vhdl
wire <= '0';
i := 2;
data <= "1010";
```

Because variables are only used inside of processes, they are not directly translated to hardware.  Signals are translated to actual wires.  Therefore, signal assignments use the `<=` operator, while variable assignments use `:=`. Pay special attention to the syntax; for a single-bit signal you should use a single quote around your value, e.g. `'0'`, but for a multi-bit vector, you use double quotes, e.g. `"1010"`.

Type conversion functions are available in VHDL packages and added to the `LIBRARY` block. Type conversion might be needed because different libraries are not logically built the same way. Certain library functions you may want to use inside your ALU might need certain type conversions. A typical example might involve converting between an `integer` and a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR` because `integer` types are not hardware types.  To perform this conversion a type casting must be employed, e.g., from integer to $STD\_LOGIC$.  Type casting can be accomplished with a function and the typical function needs an argument and a size where it will all fit.

Version control helps keep track of changes made to code. If something goes wrong, it allows comparisons between different versions of the code, making it possible to revert to a previous version. Git, along with Subversion (SVN), are examples of version control systems.  It's important to couple group numbers. The choice you make is for the rest of your class. Students, including those working online, should take groups of two.

Git is a popular version control system. Its history dates back to the Linux kernel. From 1991 to 2002, the Linux kernel was distributed using patches and files. In 2002, Bitkeeper, a propriety version control management system, was used. By 2005, the relationship ended between the open-source community and Bitkeeper. Afterward, Git was created by Linus Torvalds.

Some commands for Git include Git push, Git pull, Git clone, Git init, Git add, Git rm, Git commit and Git status.

There are best practices for using Git. Only commit files that cannot be regenerated, such as: executable files, object files, and Word documents. Only add files that are text-oriented. Version control provides safety such that when things go wrong, you can revert to the previous working state, without the need to rebuild things again. Version control is done all the time. It's important to remember to add files to the repository after the directory is versioned, for the files to be also under version control. Version control also serves as a convenient way to share code with others. It is also a convenient way to share code with others. It works by pushing the local repository to a remote, in effect creating your version in a safe location, so if the laptop crashes, the code in its latest state can be retrieved.

Git version control has certain best practices to keep in mind. You should only put files under version control that cannot be easily regenerated. This means source code goes under version control, but the compiled result (like a .hex file for an FPGA) does not.  For example, while you might write the source material for a document in a Word file, you typically wouldn't place the word document under version control. This is because a Word document is saved in a binary format rather than as simple text, and it's difficult to merge binary files. You really only want to add text-oriented files (except for PDF). If you try to merge two binary files, you can run into significant problems, like data corruption. In the Star Trek universe, it is like teleporting two people on the transporter at the same spot, resulting in a *very* bad outcome. Therefore, only text-oriented files like `.txt`, `.vhd`, `.c`, or `.cpp` should be put under version control. A `.pdf` file is an exception and is usually okay to include. When you get a new version of a binary file like a Word document, you should completely replace the old version, not try to merge them, to prevent issues.

There are two main ways to start a Git project. The easiest is to start with a *remote* repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab and then *clone* it to your local machine. With this method, you create the remote repository, then you clone the remote repository locally using the `git clone` command. After creating the remote repository at a location like `git/hub-lab`, you copy the URL. Then, you clone this remote repository locally using the command `git clone` followed by pasting the URL copied previously. Next, you add files using the `git add` command. After adding the files, you commit those files using the command `git commit -a -m`. Finally, you push the local repository to the remote repository.

Alternatively, you can create a *local* repository and then *push* it to a remote. For those new to Git, starting with a remote repository and cloning it locally tends to be easier. GitLab is often recommended since it is free. When creating the remote, it is best *not* to use your business or organizational account. You should make a new account just for this course. After making the account, create a repository and clone the repository locally.
When starting locally, you follow the steps: first, create remote repository at git or hub lab, then copy the url. Second, clone the remote repository locally using `git clone ..`. Third, add files using `git add`. Fourth, commit the files using `git commit -a -m`, and fifth, push the local repo to remote. Word of caution, with Github, you must work with public or private key pair authentication. With Gitlab you can use user and password authentication, where you specify a username and password combination.

If you want to work from a project that is given you, clone the repository directly from GitLab. You should make sure it doesn't go into your account so you have it for your personal work. Be careful not to follow a path of branching and merging; this can be tricky. Consider using Git's "stash" feature. Stashing is a way to put your local work aside temporarily. At the moment that you've teleported there, you still have all your changes, but you put those to the side so then you can pool in from remote. You then have all of those to work with. When you have all of that, you can take your changes back in. 
You can create an account at GitLab or GitHub and create a repository (making it private if desired). Clone the repository to your local machine. Create a file named "test.txt" and add some text to it (you can use a text editor like Emacs). Then, add the "test.txt" file to your local repository. Commit the changes with a comment and push to remote. The last step is to make your instructor a "Reporter" on the project.

To start working on the FPGA, it's necessary to clone the git repository locally. Once cloned, the "blinky.qpf" file can be opened. For those new to this tool, opening it allows you to view the code.

After opening the "blinky.qpf" project, you can compile the code. To do so, locate and click on the 'Start Compilation' button.

When compilation is complete, you're ready to program the FPGA. First, verify that the USB-Blaster is correctly set up by checking for "USB-Blaster [USB-0]" in the setup, it shows the connection to the hardware. If you encounter issues, you might need to install the specific drivers, which can sometimes fail at the end of the installation due to a certificate issue. Ensure you have access to the proper zip file to download the required drivers and that you extract it. Also, note that sometimes the kernel isolation may need to be disabled.

With the correct USB Blaster device selected, you can click the 'Start' button to begin programming. Once the process is ongoing, a small LED on the FPGA should start to flicker. With "blinky" open, to address any errors, double click on an error, this will take you directly to where that specific mistake is occurring. In most situations, this is all that is needed to then be able to have it be properly completed, though again, note kernel isolation can create issues, if they come up.

The goal is to get the programming working. To then see that it works correctly after that is done, look for a flashing LED and a compilation that does not give errors. After completing these steps, you have successfully established your toolchain. Keep in mind that for the Debug Exercise, in the folder path  'han-soc-examples', you will find all project examples in the exercises located in the  'debug\_exc\_ch04\_exm04\_4' folder which will be the one to open next for the following exercise.

The goal is to make the provided code compile without errors, this involves identifying and correcting the syntax errors within the code. Double-clicking on the error messages will often direct you to the specific line where the error occurs. After the presenter successfully adds some missing code the compilation fails. The presenter explains that the assignment is now for the audience to fix the errors and make the code compile. Double-clicking on the error messages will navigate to the specific lines where issues are located in the code, and is helpful for identifying the locations in the code.

The presented Verilog code describes an entity named `cho2_exco2_1_when_left_is`. The entity declaration establishes the input and output ports. The input ports are `a` and `b`, which are 8-bit wide input signals, and `sel`, which is a 2-bit wide selection signal. The output port is `x`, which is an 8-bit wide output signal. The signals a, b and x are defined as standard logic vectors.

The architecture section implements the logic of the entity. It includes a process that is sensitive to changes in the input signal `sel`. Inside the architecture, a case statement is used to define the behavior of the output `x` based on the value of the selection signal `sel`. If `sel` is `"00"`, then `x` is assigned the value `"00000000"`. If `sel` is `"01"`, then `x` is assigned the value `"ELSE"`. If `sel` is `"10"`, then `x` is assigned the value `"ELSE"`. If `sel` is none of those previous values, then `x` is assigned the value `"ZZZZZZZZ"`. The assignment `"ELSE"` in the when clauses are syntactically incorrect; valid assignments should be standard logic vectors.

In VHDL, you can have multiple listeners on a single source, which means multiple components can read data from the same source. However, you cannot have multiple drivers for one listener; that creates a conflict. Imagine multiple people trying to listen to one person – that works. But imagine multiple people all trying to tell the same person different things at the same time – that won't work well. This concept relates to how you select different segments within VHDL code. In a given process, within an entity, you can only create a pin once that is, an output can only be driven from one place; it has a one-to-one relationship.  A student is having trouble getting his hardware to run the "Blinky" program, even though programming has apparently worked.  This means that the code that makes an LED blink has been loaded onto the device, but it's not working. The instructor suggests they look at the problem together the following week.
