# Karnaugh Maps, Flip-Flops, PLDs, FPGAs, and VHDL
## Simplifying Logic, Understanding Sequential Circuits, and Programming Hardware

A Karnaugh map, or K-map, is a way to simplify a logic equation. A Sum of Products (SOP) expression is a way to write a logic equation where you have several 'AND' terms added together with 'OR' operations.

Now let's look at how to find the SOP from a K-map. The K-map provided is a 4x4 grid, where each cell represents a combination of the inputs A, B, C, and D. The goal is to find the simplest SOP expression that represents the '1's in the K-map.

In this specific K-map, the cells with value '1' are:

*   `A=0, B=1, C=1, D=0`
*   `A=0, B=1, C=1, D=1`
*   `A=1, B=1, C=1, D=0`
*   `A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1`

We need to group these 1's together in the largest possible groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 that are rectangular and have sides that are powers of 2.

In this K-map, we can make one big group consisting of cells for which $B=1$ and $C=1$. This is a rectangle containing all four 1's. This corresponds to the term $BC$. Because the 1's are in the $B$ row and $C$ column, the sum of products equation simplifies to $BC$.

The rules for creating groups within the K-map are that the group should be a power of two. So one cell, two cells, four cells, eight cells, etc. The larger the group is, the smaller the expression will be and the better the simplification. We also want to keep the number of groups to a minimum. Groups can overlap with each other to include more ones. The more ones the groups contain, the less literals there will be in the terms. For example, if A is zero, we write $\overline{A}$ where $\overline{ }$ represents the negation or complement of the variable and if A is one we write $A$. If A switches or is irrelevant we don't include it in our group. So in our sum of products term, $BC$ indicates that B and C must be true, and A and D don't matter. We express it as a sum, meaning we $OR$ the product terms together. The final expression is therefore $F = BC$.

When we use this method for minimizing the terms, we find the sum of products expression, the SOP, in simplified form for the function that corresponds to the Karnaugh map.

Another problem involves the timing diagram of input clock and outputs O1 and O2 over a period of six clock cycles. The circuit contains two D flip-flops connected in series. The output Q from the first flip-flop is connected to the D input of the second flip-flop, and O2 is equivalent to Q2. Output O1 is an inverted Q1. These flip-flops respond to the rising edge of the clock signal. For every clock cycle, the D input is transferred to the Q output of that flip-flop, so it takes two cycles to reach the O2/Q2 output.

It's important to understand what happens with the flip-flop over six clock cycles. With each rising edge of the clock signal, the data input (D) is transferred to the output Q. Due to the inverted output, O1 shows the inverse of the Q output from the first flip-flop. Since O2 is equivalent to Q2, a rising edge takes two clock rising edges for the D bit on input to be transferred to output Q2.

Another question is about the following logic is using “falling-edge-sensitivity. The correct logic element using “falling-edge-sensitivity” is B. The small circle on the clock pin next to the triangle on element B show “falling-edge-sensitivity”.

Finally, we have a follow-up question after how many clock rising edges, an input bit is transferred to output Q2 in the following circuit?

The presented circuit is a series of D flip-flops with each Q output connected to the next D input. With each clock pulse, the D value is transferred to the Q value. D0 is transferred to Q0. D1 to Q1, D2 to Q2, and D3 to Q3. It will take two clock cycles for D0 to reach the Q2 position so D2 requires 2 clock cycles, or an answer of “B. 2”

A flip-flop with a clock uses rising edge triggering. The triangle represents the edge, while the circle indicates positive or negative sensitivity. A latch with a zero means a logical zero is active.

Consider a circuit with four D flip-flops connected in series. The question is: how many rising edges of the clock are needed for an input bit at Data to transfer to the output at Q2? For D flip-flops, each rising edge of the clock transfers the data to the next flip-flop. So it takes three clock pulses for the input to reach Q2. The first clock pulse transfers the data from $D_0$ to $Q_0$, the second from $D_1$ to $Q_1$, and the third from $D_2$ to $Q_2$. It is important to use the same clock for all flip-flops. At each rising edge of the clock, the D flip-flop copies the input data to the output. Therefore, to get the input data from $D_0$ to $Q_2$ takes three clock pulses.

Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed to implement various logic functions. These devices are essential components in modern digital systems, offering flexibility and customization. Programmable Logic Array (PLA) and Programmable Array Logic (PAL) were the first PLDs, dating back to the 1970s. These early PLDs consisted of arrays of logic gates (AND and OR gates) and could implement only combinational circuits; they lacked flip-flops for sequential logic.

Generic Array Logic (GAL), introduced in the early 1980s, improved on previous designs by adding a macrocell to each output. This macrocell included a flip-flop and several multiplexers for data routing, enabling GALs to implement more complex sequential logic functions.

Complex PLDs (CPLDs), developed in the mid-1980s, combined multiple GALs and other features into a single package. CPLDs offer higher density and performance than GALs, while maintaining low cost and power consumption.

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) emerged in the mid-1980s. They can implement very large and complex high-performance systems. An FPGA offers a high degree of flexibility because the connections between the logic elements can be configured by the designer after manufacturing.

While working with hardware, problems like getting UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) connections reversed between transmit (TX) and receive (RX) can cause issues. For example, connecting TX to TX or RX to RX instead of TX to RX and RX to TX. Such problems can be incredibly frustrating, as it may appear that nothing is working, even though the rest of the circuit design might be correct. This situation is often lightheartedly called "UART dyslexia".

Despite these minor setbacks, VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) offers a significant advantage. VHDL allows the engineer to define and modify designs in a digital environment, as opposed to only in the physical hardware space. If a mistake is made in a VHDL design, it can be corrected relatively easily in the code. The printed circuit board (PCB) can then be re-programmed with the corrected design. This benefit makes working with VHDL efficient. It also enables rapid prototyping.

A disadvantage of FPGAs is that they are generally more expensive than other types of programmable logic devices. When laying out circuit connections on the board, a technique used by designers to ensure proper connections is to draw a line through the incorrect trace and then draw a new line indicating the correct connection.

While these development boards are effective, two-layer boards have limitations, so it is sometimes necessary to take a step back and place a wire jumper to route the signal where it is needed. It is essential to check that all signals are sitting in the correct place. Once verified, progress can be made.
However, the presenter notes that they do not consider these boards to be without their risks.

Looking at the specifications of different FPGA models reveals some interesting details. For example, the core voltage is low, about 0.9V to 1V. It is important to minimize power loss, but low voltages also allow for higher frequencies due to the setup and hold time diminishing as voltage goes down. FPGAs also contain User SRAM bits, DSP blocks (multipliers), and PLLs (phase locked loops).

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have various use cases. They are reconfigurable hardware used in logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and mobile communication base stations like 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. FPGAs are also used in digital signal processing for software-defined radio. An FPGA can take 30 MHz in one go to perform pre-processing. This data can then be transferred via gigabit Ethernet and accessed over the internet. At one time, the shown FPGA was the largest available that could be probed by hand. Nowadays, Ball Grid Array (BGA) packaging places the pins on the bottom, making hand-soldering impossible. A software-defined radio can be accessed through a web browser by going to the webSDR link provided, webSDR.ewi.utwente.nl:8901. You can buy an FPGA for around 300 euros, connect it to the internet, and listen to radio from your browser. There are also Kiwi SDR software-defined radios with listening networks around the globe that can be used by hobbyists to perform measurements to determine the location of a signal's source, a process called time difference of arrival. This can help determine, for example, if a signal is originating from Russia.

VHDL stands for Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language and it's a hardware description language (HDL). VHDL code describes the behavior or structure of an electronic circuit. VHDL applications involve synthesizing digital circuits onto Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) or FPGAs, layout and mask generation for Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) fabrication (synthesis), and simulating to test if the intended functionality is achieved by the synthesized circuit. VHDL history starts with the US Department of Defense in 1987 and it was the first HDL standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Later versions in 1993, 2002, and 2008 are vendor-independent. It is crucial to remember that VHDL is not a programming language, but rather a *description* language.

VHDL is used to synthesize digital circuits that will ultimately be built on an FPGA. VHDL applications can also be used to generate layouts and masks to fabricate ASICs. This is the core of what's happening in chip manufacturing facilities like those of ASML in the Netherlands.

ARM, a large manufacturer of microprocessor architectures, does not build anything. Instead, ARM makes a VHDL architecture that they sell as intellectual property (IP). Companies that purchase a license to the IP receive the design of a tested microprocessor. They add things like General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) ports, and create products unique to the license holder's requirements. The System-on-a-Chip (SoC) devices then create silicon.

The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) design flow involves starting with specifications then translating it into VHDL code. Next, analysis and synthesis is conducted, often using a synthesis tool. The synthesizer breaks the code into hardware blocks. Then, Place and Route (Fitter) is performed and a fitter generates timing information. Functional simulation is performed after code analysis and synthesis and timing simulation is done after Place and Route. This results in a programming file, which is downloaded to the physical device CPLD and FPGA.

Here are some simple syntax rules for working with VHDL. VHDL is not case-sensitive, and comments start with two dashes (--). Use normal coding styles including lowerCamelCase, sensible names, indenting, and clean coding. RESERVED words in VHDL are CAPITALIZED.

First time right refers to accomplishing a working design correctly the first time. That is the goal when writing VHDL for an FPGA.

The development begins with defining the specifications for the design. These are then translated into VHDL code. The VHDL code is then analyzed, and a functional simulation is performed to ensure the design works as intended. Once validated, place and route are determined using a "fitter," followed by timing simulation. Because electrical signals take a certain time to travel from A to B, and this time must fall within the time constraints for the circuit, timing simulations are essential to the operation of the design. The specifications are then translated into a programming file which is subsequently downloaded to a device.

As a final point, on a final device, it first reads what's held in read-only memory before a specific execution. You're then erasing it, adding your own thing, but you need everything it says.

In VHDL, case sensitivity does not matter; you can use uppercase or lowercase letters interchangeably, except for reserved words which must be in CAPITAL letters. Comments in VHDL start with two hyphens '--'. It is recommended to use a normal coding style in VHDL, which includes using `lowerCamelCase` for names (starting with a lowercase letter, and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent word, like `myVariableName`), using "sensible names" that clearly indicate the variable or signal's purpose, indenting code blocks for better readability, and using clean coding practices for maintainability.

Two hyphens followed by an exclamation mark "--!" are used for comments that should be interpreted as Doxygen documentation. Doxygen is a tool for automatically generating documentation from code comments.

To quickly comment out a block of code, select the code, and use the shortcut `Ctrl+/` which will put two hyphens in front of each line, making the selected code into a comment.

For VHDL, the normal coding style, called `lowerCamelCase`, is recommended. Lower camel case means that you begin a variable name with a small letter, and subsequent words within the variable name start with a capital letter, for example: `myVariableName`.

There is another possibility to give names for the signal or variable but it's advised to use the `lowerCamelCase`. It's good practice to use "sensible names" meaning the names of the variables, signals, etc. should mean something and describe what they're used for. If programming in C, it's common to see variables named 'a', 'b', 'c', however with a language like VHDL it's important that you use sensible names, because it makes the code more readable and easier to understand. If writing a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, use "fahrenheitToCelsiusF" rather than just "A B".

The VHDL code is typically structured into three blocks: the library block, the entity block, and the architecture block. First, there is the header which allows you to create header block with information about the file.

In VHDL you have the libraries, that include the standard logic, such as `ieee`
$$
\text{LIBRARY ieee;}
$$
$$
\text{USE ieee.std\_logic\_1164.ALL;}
$$

Here, STD_LOGIC is an extension of "BIT" and defines the 9-value type STD_LOGIC that represents real-world circuits. It is helpful to know why STD_LOGIC has nine values. An uninitialized wire, denoted with 'U', signifies that at power-up, it has not yet been assigned a definite value. 'X' means that it's forcing unknown.

'0' means forcing low and '1' means forcing high.

When a wire or signal is forced low, there are a few things that could happen.

*Forcing low* implies that there's a transistor to ground, meaning the low level on the signal is guaranteed by some digital circuit, and there are some different electrical properties of the signals. What is the maximum value it'll get to when its forcing low? 0.6 because there is a transistor.

What will happen in case of 'forcing high'? Forcing High has a pull-up resistor. Because of resistors, it's not guaranteed. As a result, it is important to consider these small electric properties. Then when it comes to do it right, it will result in a high grade.

It's also important to do intending, to have the code make it as easy to see what is happening. To do "clean coding," is to make sure you take the time to line things up.

VHDL code is structured into 3 blocks: the library block, the entity block, and the architecture block. VHDL is object oriented meaning that the code will need to follow a specific structure. When building a program in VHDL you begin with a library block, then the entity block, followed by architecture block. The Library block supports definitions and functions. The ENTITY block includes CONSTANTS and PORTS to interface with the outside world. The ARCHITECTURE block includes signals to interconnect to description of functionality of hardware in concurrent or sequential code.

For the VHDL library block includes all libraries and packages for a design, most commonly used libraries are IEEE, STD, and WORK. LIBRARY IEEE has USE iee.std_logic_1164.ALL. std_logic is an extension of BIT and defines the 9-value type STD_LOGIC that represents real-world circuits.

The entity block when describing VHDL is to define the name of chip and describe how many pins there are, what the functions of the pins are (In/Out). Architecture block there you declare what kind of wires you will use (signals) and describe functionality of the signals by signals to connect the components. It may include either "concurrent" or "sequential" code blocks. You need to declare the data to use upfront what it is, name them how many for example, you need to declare with that is what that signal going to be high or low impedance it's a standard language you can write something so the signal you want it in a certain order.

Different STD_LOGIC meanings:
*   'U' means Uninitialized, a power up and not yet assigned value.
*   'X' means forcing unknown.
*   '0' means forcing low.
*   '1' means forcing high.
*   'Z' means High impedance.
*   'W' means Weak unknown.
*   'L' means Weak low.
*   'H' means Weak high.
*   '-' means Don't care

STD_LOGIC uses nine symbols, including 'U' for Uninitialized, meaning the signal hasn't been given a starting value. 'X' stands for Forcing unknown, typically meaning there are conflicting signals trying to drive a line, resulting in an unpredictable value. '0' means Forcing low, actively driving the line to a low voltage, and '1' means Forcing high, actively driving the line to a high voltage. 'Z' indicates High impedance, meaning the line is not being actively driven, and is effectively floating, while 'W' represents Weak unknown. 'L' signifies Weak low, a signal pulled to a low voltage with a weak driver, and 'H' means Weak high, pulled to a high voltage with a weak driver. Finally, '-' represents Don't care, meaning the value of the signal is irrelevant for the specific logic being evaluated.

Forcing low can sometimes cause issues. If something else is trying to make a line high, forcing low may create a contention issue. A transistor, when used to force a line low, will pull it close to zero, but not perfectly. A typical transistor might pull it down to $0.6$V, not actually $0$V.

'Don't care' is a logical concept indicating that the signal's actual value doesn't matter in a particular context, which has implications for hardware descriptions. Hardware description languages are used to describe how hardware should behave, and tell the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) what its behaviour should be.

Tri-state buffers can be either one, zero, or floating (high impedance). A floating state is important on data buses, where devices should only drive the bus when it's their turn to "speak".

In VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), an ENTITY block contains all the PORTs and GENERICs. PORTs implement the input-output diagram. For example:

```vhdl
ENTITY ch3_exm03_1 IS -- Was "tri_state"
PORT (
    input: IN STD_LOGIC;
    enable: IN STD_LOGIC;
    output: OUT STD_LOGIC
);
END ENTITY;
```

Here, `input` and `enable` are defined as inputs of the type `STD_LOGIC`. `STD_LOGIC` describes the physical signals. The `output` is an output, also of type `STD_LOGIC`.

GENERICs are used to define constants, similar to `#define` in C or C++, to parametrize a design. An example:

```vhdl
GENERIC (
    N: INTEGER := 4
);
```

Here, `N` is a constant with the value 4.

The ARCHITECTURE block contains a description of how the circuit should work. For example, a tri-state buffer with an input, an output, and an enable signal, has the following behavior:

*   If enable is '0', the output is 'Z' (high impedance).
*   If enable is '1', the output is the same as the input.

This can be described in VHDL as:

```vhdl
ARCHITECTURE tri_state OF ch3_exm03_1 IS
BEGIN
    output <= input WHEN enable = '1' ELSE 'Z';
END ARCHITECTURE;
```

This code assigns the `input` to the `output` only when `enable` is equal to `'1'`. Otherwise, the output is set to `'Z'`, which is high impedance. This is a hardware description.

In VHDL, integers are typically represented in base-10 (decimal). The default range in VHDL is from $-(2^{31} - 1)$ to $+(2^{31} - 1)$.

Hexadecimal numbers can be defined as, for instance, `16#9F#` which can be expanded as $(9 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0)$.

Binary numbers can be defined using a `b`, for example, `'0'` is `b'0'`, which equals 0. ` "0111"` is a binary sequence with the value 7 and can be written as `b"0111"` or `B"0111"`.

A `BIT` is like a single wire while `BIT_VECTOR` is like a flat cable with numbered lines. A bit represents a single wire which can either have a voltage or not, this represents information in the form of 1 and 0.

When declaring a `BIT_VECTOR`, it's necessary to specify the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and Least Significant Bit (LSB), which can be done using the `DOWNTO` or `TO` keywords. For instance: `cable: OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (7 DOWNTO 0)`. In this example the Most Significant Bit is 7 and the Least Significant Bit is 0. When used with the `DOWNTO` keyword, the bits are counted from high to low from MSB to LSB, and when used with the `TO` keyword the bits are counted from low to high, from LSB to MSB. It is only valid to connect vectors with the same ordering, meaning to connect MSB first signals to MSB first signals, and LSB first signals to LSB first signals.
