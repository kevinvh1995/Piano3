# Binary Arithmetic, Logic Gates, and Boolean Algebra
## Conversion, Two's Complement, Logic Gate Fundamentals, and De Morgan's Laws

To convert a decimal number to binary, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2, noting the quotient and the remainder at each step. The remainders, when read in reverse order (from bottom to top), form the binary equivalent of the decimal number. For example, to convert $29_{10}$ to binary:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{29}{2} &= 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{14}{2} &= 7 \text{ remainder } 0 \\
\frac{7}{2} &= 3 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{3}{2} &= 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{1}{2} &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get $11101_2$. Therefore, $29_{10} = 11101_2$.

Similarly, to convert $27_{10}$ to binary:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{27}{2} &= 13 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{13}{2} &= 6 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{6}{2} &= 3 \text{ remainder } 0 \\
\frac{3}{2} &= 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\frac{1}{2} &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get $11011_2$. Therefore, $27_{10} = 11011_2$.

Now, to subtract $27_{10}$ from $29_{10}$ using two's complement arithmetic, follow these steps:

1. Convert both decimal numbers to their binary equivalents:
    *   $29_{10} = 11101_2$
    *   $27_{10} = 11011_2$

2. Find the two's complement of the number to be subtracted (i.e., $27_{10}$ or $11011_2$).
    *   First, find the one's complement by inverting all the bits: $11011_2$ becomes $00100_2$.
    *   Then, add 1 to the one's complement to get the two's complement: $00100_2 + 1_2 = 00101_2$. So, the two's complement of $11011_2$ is $00101_2$.

3. Add the first number ($29_{10}$ in binary, which is $11101_2$) to the two's complement of the second number:

    ```
      11101
    + 00101
    -------
     100010
    ```

4. Since we are using 5-bit numbers, discard any carry-over bit from the leftmost position. In this case, we discard the leading '1'. So the result is $00010_2$.

5. Convert the binary result $00010_2$ back to decimal:

    $$(0 \times 2^4) + (0 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2$$

Therefore, $29_{10} - 27_{10} = 2_{10}$. This calculation used two's complement to perform subtraction, which is equivalent to addition with the negated number.

Converting a decimal number with a fraction to binary involves converting the integer part and the fractional part separately.
First, take the integer part (e.g., 25 from $25.75_{10}$) and divide it repeatedly by 2, noting the remainders. The remainders, read from bottom to top, form the binary representation of the integer part. For the example of 25, we calculate:

$25 / 2 = 12$ with a remainder of 1
$12 / 2 = 6$ with a remainder of 0
$6 / 2 = 3$ with a remainder of 0
$3 / 2 = 1$ with a remainder of 1
$1 / 2 = 0$ with a remainder of 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives $11001_2$.

Next, deal with the fractional part (e.g., 0.75 from $25.75_{10}$). Multiply the fraction repeatedly by 2, noting the integer part of the result (either 0 or 1). These integer parts, read from top to bottom, form the binary representation of the fractional part. For the example of 0.75, the calculation is:

$0.75 \times 2 = 1.5$, so the integer part is 1. Take the remaining fractional part 0.5 and continue.
$0.5 \times 2 = 1.0$, so the integer part is 1. Take the remaining fractional part 0.0 and the process stops.
$0 \times 2 = 0$, so the integer part is 0. Stop since the fractional part is zero.

Reading the integer parts from top to bottom gives $0.11_2$.

Combine the binary representations of the integer and fractional parts with a binary point in between. Thus, $25.75_{10}$ in binary is $11001.11_2$.

Let's illustrate the reverse process: converting $11001.11_2$ back to decimal to verify.

The integer part $11001_2$ is:

$(1 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 25_{10}$.

The fractional part $0.11_2$ is:

$(1 \times 2^{-1}) + (1 \times 2^{-2}) = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75_{10}$.

Combining these gives $25.75_{10}$. Therefore, the conversion is correct.

It is noted that not all decimal fractions can be perfectly represented with a finite number of digits in binary. For instance, trying to convert $0.33_{10}$ to binary will result in a repeating binary fraction. With only two binary fractional places, $0.33_{10}$ could be approximated by either $0.5_{10}$ or $0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75_{10}$ in binary. This is an example of quantization error, a form of distortion that results from representing a continuous range of values with a discrete set of values. Increasing the number of bits used for the fractional part reduces this error.

When converting an analog signal to digital form, there will be a degree of signal distortion. How much distortion is acceptable depends on the particular application and what an end user might be able to perceive.

Digital logic uses symbols to represent logic gates. There are two sets of symbols commonly used, defined by the ANSI/IEEE standard. As these symbols can be tedious to draw, in practice the square blocks are more commonly used.
An AND gate performs a logical AND operation. It has two or more inputs, and a single output. The output is 1 only if all the inputs are 1; otherwise, the output is 0. The standard symbol for an AND gate has a curved shape on one side. A more modern, simplified symbol often uses a rectangular shape with the '&' symbol inside to represent the AND operation. The behavior of a two-input AND gate can be described using a truth table:

| A | B | C = A AND B |
|---|---:|:-------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0           |
| 0 | 1 | 0           |
| 1 | 0 | 0           |
| 1 | 1 | 1           |

Here A and B are the inputs, and C is the output. The AND operation is often written as a multiplication, such that $C = A \cdot B$ or simply $C=AB$.

A three-input AND gate has the following truth table, where D represents the output:

| A | B | C | D = A AND B AND C |
|---|---:|:---:|:-----------------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0                |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0                |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0                |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0                |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0                |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0                |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0                |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1                |

It's logically true that all inputs to an AND gate must be 1 for the output to be 1. In practice, chips with three-input AND gates aren't commonly found. Instead, multiple two-input AND gates are combined to achieve the same result.
For an AND gate, if an input $A$ is ANDed with 1 (i.e., $A \cdot 1$), the result is always $A$. If $A$ is ANDed with 0 (i.e., $A \cdot 0$), the result is always 0, as this is the defining behaviour of an AND gate. The order of inputs does not matter for the AND operation, meaning $AB = BA$.
Also, the association of inputs when using more than two inputs does not matter: $(AB)C = A(BC) = ABC$.

An Inverter, sometimes called a NOT gate, has a single input, $A$, and a single output, $B$. It inverts the input signal. If the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa. The symbol is a triangle pointing to the right, with a small circle at the output to signify inversion. An inverter is effectively an inverting amplifier. The IEC symbol is a triangle followed by a small circle.

The operation of an inverter can be expressed as $A' = \overline{A}$, where $A'$ or $\overline{A}$ represents the inverse of $A$.

The truth table is:

| A | B = NOT A |
|---|:---------:|
| 0 | 1         |
| 1 | 0         |

Some key relationships:
$A \cdot \overline{A} = 0$ (A AND NOT A always equals zero) and $\overline{\overline{A}} = A$ (NOT NOT A gives A).

If a signal passes through multiple inverters in series, the signal is effectively delayed without changing its logic value.

OR Gate symbols are characterized as "greater than or equal to 1", and are such that if $A + 0 = A$, or $A + 1 = 1$, or $A + \overline{A} = 1$, or $A + A = A$.

DeMorgan's laws are used for logic circuit simplification and are represented as:

*   $\overline{A \cdot B} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$
*   $\overline{A + B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}$

These laws illustrate that a NAND (Not AND) gate can be equivalently represented as an OR gate with inverted inputs, and a NOR (Not OR) gate can be equivalently represented as an AND gate with inverted inputs. Importantly, not all components are built with equal transistors. We also learned that to create an inverter with a NOR Gate, we must understand we also have an inherent time delay associated when we try to create an amplifier with NOR gates.

De Morgan's laws are used to simplify Boolean expressions and digital circuits. They provide a way to express the complement of a complex expression in terms of the complements of its individual components.

The first of De Morgan's laws states that the complement of a product (AND) of two variables is equal to the sum (OR) of the complements of those variables. Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$\overline{A \cdot B} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$$

This means if you have an AND operation between A and B, and you take the inverse of the entire result, it's the same as taking the inverse of A, taking the inverse of B, and then OR-ing those inverted values. In simpler terms, a NAND gate (Not-AND) is equivalent to inverting each input to an OR gate. If A AND B is equal to 1, then the output is equal to zero. If A OR B is set to 0, then the output is equal to one.

The second of De Morgan's laws states that the complement of a sum (OR) of two variables is equal to the product (AND) of the complements of those variables. Mathematically:

$$\overline{A + B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}$$

This means that if you have an OR operation between A and B, and you take the inverse of the entire result, it is the same as taking the inverse of A, taking the inverse of B, and then AND-ing those inverted values. Therefore, a NOR gate (Not-OR) is equivalent to inverting each input to an AND gate.

An important consideration is 'logical sufficiency,' which states that any complex logic function can be constructed using just NAND gates or just NOR gates.
Thus, the basic functions AND, OR, and NOT can all be realized using only NAND gates, and they can be realized using only NOR gates.

It is possible, for example, to create an inverter (NOT gate) using either a NOR or NAND gate by connecting the inputs together.
A NOR gate can be used as an inverter. If you set both inputs A and B of a NOR gate to the same value (for example, connect them together), then the output is the inverse of that input. In logical terms, $\overline{A + A} = \overline{A}$. If A is 0, then 0 OR 0 is 0, and the inverse of 0 is 1. If A is 1, then 1 OR 1 is 1, and the inverse of 1 is 0. Hence, if $A+A$ are inputs into a NOR gate, you get $\overline{A}$ as the output.

De Morgan's laws can be applied to more complex expressions with multiple variables. For example:

$$\overline{A \cdot B + C \cdot D + E \cdot F} = \overline{A} + \overline{B} + \overline{C} + \overline{D} + \overline{E} + \overline{F}$$

In essence, when you have a long expression and you take the inverse of the entire expression, you can "break" the inverse and apply De Morgan's law piece by piece. Remember that when applying De Morgan's laws, ANDs become ORs and ORs become ANDs. Further, you do not have to break the entire string. Parts can also be separated out. So:

$$\overline{A \cdot B + C + D + E + F} = \overline{A \cdot B} \cdot  \overline{C + D + E + F}$$
$$\overline{A \cdot B} \cdot  \overline{C + D + E + F} = (\overline{A} + \overline{B}) \cdot (\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D} \cdot \overline{E} \cdot \overline{F})$$

When designing circuits, if a certain gate is not available or is difficult to implement, De Morgan's Laws provide an approach to realize the required logic function using alternative gates. Also, the key to simplifying logic gates and the goal is that even in these complex designs you need the function that results from the implementation of the logic operation.

The objective is to convert a given Boolean function, $F = (\overline{A + B}) \cdot (C + D)$, into an equivalent form using only NAND gates. A key concept is that $A = \overline{\overline{A}}$. The initial function has a NOT operation over the term $A + B$, and an AND operation combining that with $C + D$. Overall, the function is also negated. To start, a double negation is applied to the whole function to maintain equivalence, resulting in $F = \overline{\overline{(\overline{A + B}) \cdot (C + D)}}$.
Next, De Morgan's law is applied to the outermost negation. De Morgan's law states that $\overline{X \cdot Y} = \overline{X} + \overline{Y}$. Applying this gives $\overline{(\overline{A + B}) \cdot (C + D)} = \overline{\overline{A + B}} + \overline{C + D}$. Finally De Morgan's law is applied again, $\overline{X + Y} = \overline{X} \cdot \overline{Y}$, to transform the $OR$ to an $AND$, to both sub-expressions to result in $F = \overline{\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}} + \overline{\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D}}$. An AND gate can be created from NAND gates by inverting the output. Specifically, $\overline{\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}}$ is a NAND gate with inputs $\overline{A}$ and $\overline{B}$, and $\overline{\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D}}$ is a NAND gate with inputs $\overline{C}$ and $\overline{D}$. Also, inverters can be built by connecting both inputs of a NAND gate together so that $\overline{A \cdot A} = \overline{A}$. This provides the inverters necessary for A,B,C, and D inputs to the NAND gates to function as an AND. In order to eliminate the $OR$ function of $F = \overline{\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}} + \overline{\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D}}$ a NAND is used, provided that the entire statement is negated again: $F = \overline{\overline{\overline{\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}} + \overline{\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D}}}} $. And again De Morgan's Law for $X+Y$ can be invoked one last time to achieve an expression where the logic design consist of only NAND gates: $F = \overline{\overline{(\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B})} \cdot \overline{(\overline{C} \cdot \overline{D})}}$. Visually, $A$ and $B$ are inverted using a NAND gate. The output is $\overline{A}$ and $\overline{B}$, and C and D can be treated similarly such that the logic design consist of all NAND gates. This equation now consists of NAND gates only. To achieve this Boolean function, the final logical schematic can be designed consisting of NAND ports for A,B, C, and D logic signals with their outputs wired to other NAND ports, producing the intended behavior of function $F$.
